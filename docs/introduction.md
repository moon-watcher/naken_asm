Introduction
============
naken_asm is lightweight assembler / disassembler with a focus on
being easy to compile (no dependencies) and easy to use.  It was
originally called naken430asm, but since it has been expanded to
support many more CPUs it has been renamed to naken_asm.
Additionally, there is a simulator for of the supported CPUs.
